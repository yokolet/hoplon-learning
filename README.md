# Hoplon Learning

This is the slides for my [Hoplon](http://hoplon.io) study.
The slides themselves are written by Hoplon.

I started this work cloning out the slides created for
the presentation [Micha Niskin](https://github.com/micha) and [Alan Dipert](https://github.com/alandipert) gave at
[TriClojure](http://www.meetup.com/TriClojure/events/165767582/) on
2/27/2014.
Original slides are [https://github.com/alandipert/triclojure-hoplon-deck](https://github.com/alandipert/triclojure-hoplon-deck).
Slides are based on [hoplon-reveal-js][1] by
[Duncan McGreggor](https://github.com/oubiwann) and
[Clinton Dreisbach](https://github.com/cndreisbach).
